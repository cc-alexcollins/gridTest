# Grid Generator

## Usage

Use the `test` command to generate a random grid of nodes

```
npm run test
```

The system is deterministic, so you can specify a particular seed to get the same grid each time. Just add the seed you want after the `test` command.

```
npm run test 42
```

## Documentation

All the elements of the grid generation system are documented. You can view the API [here](https://github.com/cc-alexcollins/gridTest/blob/master/docs/api.md).
